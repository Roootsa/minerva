            <h1>My Biodata</h1>
            <p>Maulana Faizar Rasyadan was born in Serang on February 3 2004. I have a motto to always try to grow and develop. After graduating from school, I chose not to go straight to college. Instead, 
                I developed and applied my knowledge by becoming a teacher and secretary at a modern Islamic boarding school in the city of Rangkasbitung.
            There, I developed various secretarial skills and also learned design using Corel Draw.
            <p>I really enjoy learning new things and feel proud when I successfully overcome various obstacles in life.</p>
